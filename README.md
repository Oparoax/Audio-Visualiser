This project is a music visualiser for use in rhythm games. In games such as beatsaber and electronauts the environment is manipulated by the song being played i wanted to try and make something similar. The video and audio in the scene is from League Of Legends Awaken Animatic and fits really well as it has a very powerful and interesting soundscape that looks great when visualised.

It experiments with the ideas of manipulating a shader and a mesh determined by a processed audio source. This method could be applied to any object in a scene if you wanted it to pulse and move to either in game sound, a predetermined track or even the voice of the player.

The Shader is a combination of my own work to produce the colours and transparency effect, and a tutorial online on how to produce the ripple effect link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QsLkb1aOkb8

The Mesh is a combination of a tutorial link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64NblGkAabk , and my own work to read and update the mesh with the audio stream.
